MIRLC 2.0
===
SuperCollider extensions for using MIR techniques in live coding.

Introduction
----

The extension MIRLC2.sc is a follow-up work-in-progress of MIRLC.sc. It includes effects and more automatic behaviours. It is still under development.


Application Start
----

Drag the MIRLC2 file to the Extensions folder of SuperCollider (suggested to create a subfolder with the same name): `/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions` (in Mac). If you are unsure where is this folder, open SuperCollider and type: Platform.userExtensionDir

Either recompile the class library (`Language>Recompile Class Library`) or restart SuperCollider.

MIRLCRep2 Module
----

The MIRLCRep2 class is designed for repurposing audio samples from Freesound.org using and expanding the Freesound quark for SuperCollider.

### Requirements

* Make sure you have an Internet connection.
* Make sure you have a [Freesound.org](http://freesound.org) account.
* Make sure to obtain an [API key](https://freesound.org/help/developers/).
* Install [Freesound quark](https://github.com/g-roma/Freesound.sc), which is a SuperCollider client for accessing the Freesound API and operate with sounds from Freesound.org.
* In order to connect with Freesound.org, the type of authentication used in MIRLC is Token. Make sure to introduce your API key in the class `MIRLC2.sc` and recompile the class library.
* It is recommended that you define the 2 folders where:
	* the sounds are downloaded (write mode).
	* the sound credits list is stored (write mode).

### Additions to the Freesound quark

* Asynchronous management of multiple sounds by a single query.
* User-friendlier queries by content, similarity, tag, filter, and sound id.
* A new user-friendly query by random.
* A new architecture of groups of sounds with user-friendly functions for playing them in sequence and in parallel, which are managed asynchronously.
* A new set of functions to control both individual sounds and group of sounds (e.g., play, stop, mute single sounds, solo single sounds).
* Retrieval of sounds avoiding repetition in queries by content and similarity.
* Retrieval of sounds avoiding inexistent results in random queries.
* A customizable text file that prints the sounds used by title and username.

### Additions to MIRLC.sc

* Audio effects.
* Automatic functions for querying, retrieving and playing sounds.
* Error reporting.
