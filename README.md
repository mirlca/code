Introduction
----

The MIRLCa repository includes the following folders:

* **Datasets**: Examples of datasets that indicate how the datasets are structured. This folder is just for informative purposes.
* **Diagrams**: Hand-written diagrams that illustrate how the system works. This folder is just for informative purposes.
* **Extensions**: The two extensions that you will need for making MIRLCa work: MIRLCa and MIRLC2. You will also need the Freesound quark, which is explained in the README file of MIRLC2. 
* **JSON**: The 3 JSON files required for the machine learning of MIRLCa.
* **Tutorials**: SuperCollider tutorials on how to use MIRLCa for automatic training and performing. There's also an example of manual training. This folder is just for informative purposes.
